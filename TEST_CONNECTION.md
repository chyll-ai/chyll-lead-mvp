# Test Railway PostgreSQL Connection

## ðŸŽ‰ **PostgreSQL Mounted Successfully!**

Now that you've mounted PostgreSQL into your `chyll-lead-mvp` service, let's test the connection.

## ðŸ“‹ **Test Connection:**

### **Option 1: Using Railway CLI**
```bash
# Link to your service
railway service chyll-lead-mvp

# Test connection
railway run python3 test_mounted_connection.py
```

### **Option 2: Manual Test**
If CLI has issues, you can test directly in your Railway dashboard:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
2. **Click on chyll-lead-mvp service**
3. **Go to "Deployments" tab**
4. **Click "View Logs"**
5. **Run a test command**

## ðŸ”§ **Expected Results:**

If connection is successful, you should see:
```
âœ… Connected successfully!
PostgreSQL version: PostgreSQL 15.x
Database size: 0 bytes (empty database)
Connected to database: railway
ðŸŽ‰ PostgreSQL connection successful!
Ready to start loading Sirene data!
```

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps:**

Once connection is confirmed:

1. **Start Loading Sirene Data**:
   ```bash
   railway run python3 load_sirene_railway.py
   ```

2. **Expected Performance**:
   - **Loading Speed**: ~1-2M rows/minute
   - **Total Time**: ~20-30 minutes
   - **Final Size**: ~42M establishments + ~20M legal units

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Will Work:**

- **Railway Pro**: 32GB RAM + 250GB storage
- **Persistent Storage**: No data loss on restarts
- **Mounted Service**: Database accessible to your FastAPI
- **No Docker Issues**: Railway handles infrastructure

Your setup is now perfect for loading the 42M row Sirene database! ðŸš€
